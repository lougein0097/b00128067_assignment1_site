      <h3>Tourism</h3>
      <p>Istanbul seems to create an appealing balance between the elegant design of its heritage places and the far more urban appearance of its skyscrapers and shopping malls. There are many interesting spots to explore in and around the area, as well as locations with stunning views of the city and the Marmara Sea.</p>
      <p>You can admire majestic mosques, beautiful temples, fascinating museums, and Sultans' (Sovereign) palaces, or go on a walk to the Bosphorus to eat fresh fish and overlook the Black Sea. </p>

		<h4>
Hagia Sophia, a significant Byzantine architecture in Istanbul and one of the world's major standing monuments. It was constructed as a Christian church in the sixth century under the rule of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, it has since become a Mosque and a museum.

	 <h4>The Sultanahmet Mosque was built between 1609 and 1617 and is regarded as the Blue Mosque because of the blue tiles used to beautify its internal walls. Sultan Ahmet I funded the building of the Blue Mosque. The plan was to build a structure that would not only compete with, but also outperform, the glorious Hagia Sophia. Both Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque are located in centre of Sultan Ahmet where tourist can visit.
